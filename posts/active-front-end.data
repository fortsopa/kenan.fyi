> AFE is used instead of brake chopper circuitry to eliminate power loss over a resistor in applications, where generator mode operation is triggered considerably lot. For simple applications a brake chopper and a braking resistor would be enough.

AFE is a line-side converter that provides a constant DC link voltage for a voltage source PWM Inverter. Circuitry inside the AFE consists of a PWM Inverter. On the AC Side, it is not connected to a motor obviously but to the line side and this means instead of a standard [B2-B6 Connection](B2-B6-Connection) with diodes, power flow can be realized backwards to the line from the DC Link of the inverter.

AFE is generally used at applications where there is a considerable amount of generator operation which means the power flow is changing its direction often to the line supply side. Instead of using a [[Brake Chopper]] to eliminate the excessive voltage generated in the DC Link with a resistor, an AFE is used to supply this excessive power back to the grid.
